# SNAKE GAME

every java-beginner should do something like this :)

> • Snake: the class of the snake.
>
> • MainGame: the class of the game-field where the snake will crawl.
>
> • Mouse: a class that creates mice for the snake to eat.
>
> • KeybordReader: keyboard event listener.
>
> • SnakeDirection: an enum class that describes the direction the snake's moves.
>
> • SnakeSection: a class describing a snake's section.


The project implements the following:
• Working with the collection;

• Working with a queue that implements the classic circular buffer;

• Working with multithreading;

• Working with an event listener;
